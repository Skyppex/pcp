# pcp

pcp is a parallel copy/move utility with safety and speed as the main focus

## Goals

- performance: aims to be fast by default
- safety: when copying files you want to be sure nothing get corrupted or lost
- progress: should be able to track progress and continue when it left off
- cross-platform: long term, pcp should work on Windows, Linux and macOS
